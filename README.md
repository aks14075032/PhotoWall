# Manchester United Fanwall
I'm Manchester United Fan and was in one the group where people wanted to keep photos and comments on them at one place. So designed this
project which is built using React at frontend and Firebase at backend. Here user can upload photo and comment on the photo and also can see the activity of other users.
